# TODO

Never save items to the DB?

Every time I visit '/', its a new app? Only manipulate todo items in JS?

'CLEAR' link only clears checked items on list

'NEW' link appends the new item form, 'submit' removed form and appends new item.

Items are sorted by 'cid'.



'Save this list' at the bottom?

If user chooses to save the list, save each item and give them an ID# (e.g., 'TODO.com/12345').

When a user goes to that exact URL, they can manipulate the list again.
